# Live2DExample
This repo is your example folder that I will be adding to over a series of Live 2D example streams!
You will find a blank slate model for you to use that already has everything separated out for your usage.
You may find that some items are still in Japanese -- I recommend keeping it if you're trying to learn
or simply throwing it into a translator if you don't wanna bother. I did my best to remove most of
it but I am sure I forgot some parameter names somewhere.

Best of Luck!
