### This Stream Assumes:

1. You have a model ready to go:
  What does that mean? You have an anime/character model that has had all
  of the facial features and body parts separated. I will review how mine is
  broken up and how other models are broken up for reference. You cannot start
  rigging until this is completely finished.

  If you do not have a model to go, use !repo to get access to my prepared
  repo which will have a rig file for you. It will be the `simple` model
  that can be found on the Live2D website which is intended for practice. I have removed
  all of the animations on this model and rotations so it is fresh for you to start working on
  alongside me!

2. You have installed Live2D Cubism.

3. You can grasp an illustrator like program, and understand the points of parameters/vectors.
(In a very generic sense, I will explain further.)

I will be reviewing the face and hair today, which I think are the key points of
live2D rigging. We will cover parameters and deformers. I will not be covering dealing with the
open mouth, as it can take the longest time.
